#3. For this problem, use the dictionary from the beginning of this chapter whose keys are month names
# and whose values are the number of days in the corresponding months.
 #(a) Ask the user to enter a month name and use the dictionary to tell them how many days are in the month.
 #(b) Print out all of the keys in alphabetical order.
 #(c) Print out all of the months with 31 days.
 #(d) Print out the (key-value) pairs sorted by the number of days in each month
 #(e) Modify the program from part (a) and the dictionary so that the user does not have to know
# how to spell the month name exactly. That is, all they have to do is spell the first three letters of the month name correctly.

#4. Write a program that uses a dictionary that contains ten user names and passwords.
# The program should ask the user to enter their username and password.
# If the username is not in the dictionary, the program should indicate that the person
# is not a valid user of the system. If the username is in the dictionary, but the user does not enter the right
# password, the program should say that the password is invalid. If the password is correct,
# then the program should tell the user that they are now logged in to the system.
